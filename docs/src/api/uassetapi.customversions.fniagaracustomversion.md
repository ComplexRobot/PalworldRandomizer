| VisibilityCullingImprovements | 71 | Extended visibility culling options and moved properties into their own struct. |

| RibbonPlaneUseGeometryNormals | 81 | Ribbon renderer will use geometry normals by default rather than screen / facing aligned normals |
| InitialOwnerVelocityFromActor | 82 | Actors velocity is used for the initial velocity before the component has any tracking, old assets use the old zero velocity |
| ParameterBindingWithValueRenameFixup | 83 | FNiagaraParameterBindingWithValue wouldn't necessarily have the appropriate ResolvedParameter namespace when it comes to emitter merging |
| SimCache_BulkDataVersion1 | 84 | Sim Cache moved to bulk data by default |
| InheritanceUxRefactor | 85 | Decoupling of 'Template' and 'Inheritance' |
| NDCSpawnGroupOverrideDisabledByDefault | 86 | NDC Read DIs will not override spawn group by default when spawning particles. Old content will remain unchanged. |

## Fields

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --: | --- |
| CLASS_None | 0 | No Flags |
| CLASS_Abstract | 1 | Class is abstract and can't be instantiated directly. |
| CLASS_DefaultConfig | 2 | Save object configuration only to Default INIs, never to local INIs. Must be combined with CLASS_Config |

| CLASS_ProjectUserConfig | 64 | Indicates that the config settings for this class will be saved to Project/User*.ini (similar to CLASS_GlobalUserConfig) |
| CLASS_Native | 128 | Class is a native class - native interfaces will have CLASS_Native set, but not RF_MarkAsNative |
| CLASS_NoExport | 256 | Don't export to C++ header. |
| CLASS_NotPlaceable | 512 | Do not allow users to create in the editor. |
| CLASS_PerObjectConfig | 1024 | Handle object configuration on a per-object basis, rather than per-class. |
| CLASS_ReplicationDataIsSetUp | 2048 | Whether SetUpRuntimeReplicationData still needs to be called for this class |
| CLASS_EditInlineNew | 4096 | Class can be constructed from editinline New button. |
| CLASS_CollapseCategories | 8192 | Display properties in the editor without using categories. |
| CLASS_Interface | 16384 | Class is an interface |

| CLASS_HasInstancedReference | 8388608 | Class has component properties. |
| CLASS_Hidden | 16777216 | Don't show this class in the editor class browser or edit inline new menus. |
| CLASS_Deprecated | 33554432 | Don't save objects of this class when serializing |
| CLASS_HideDropDown | 67108864 | Class not shown in editor drop down for class selection |
